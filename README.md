# Kinesis as an Event Collector

Kinesis can be used as an Event Collector Service.
The clients, for example mobile devices, push events directly into a Kinesis Stream.

In this exercise the incoming events are generated by reading them from a file or creating them randomly.

## Naive Python

Simplest design consists of two modules.

1. The `producer`, which reads the data from the file sequentially.
Transforms CSV raw data into an event.
Creates a batch of event data.
Then pushes a batch into the Kinesis stream.

2. A `consumer`, which polls from the Kinesis stream.
Aggregates the event data.
And writes the result into persistent storage.


### Setup
use `virtualenvwrapper` and create a *virtual environment* for python.
```
mkvirtualenv streams
```

install the packages into the *virtual environment*
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Run

```
python producer.py
```
